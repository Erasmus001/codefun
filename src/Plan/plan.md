<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

There are many great online coding platforms available on the internet; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I decided build this enhanced one. I want to create an online coding plaform so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others.
* You shouldn't be paying for huge sum of money for a theory based course.
* You shouldn't be building simple ToDo applications that doesnt enhance your learning.
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€.

Of course, no one course will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the great minds who have contributed to expanding this project ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž!
